A standalone battery power indicator tray icon.

About
-----

*BatteryBud is in the early phases of development. Please report bugs and feature requests on GitHub.*

BatteryBud is a battery power indicator. It sits in your system tray and displays a little icon that tells you if your laptop is charging or needs to be charged.

BatteryBud currently depends on the `UPower Device DBus Specification <https://upower.freedesktop.org/docs/Device.html>`__ but other backends will be supported in the future upon request.

TODO
----

Right now, it just shows an icon that indicates how charged the battery is and whether or not it is charging but more work is planned.

* Support more backends to get battery status (currently only tested on Fedora 26)
* Hover tooltip that shows time remaining on the battery charge
* Display detailed battery info
* Change the color/appearance of the icon
